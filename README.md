We now have a list of vulnerable target securities that we're going to work on exploiting:
CMBS
Shadow bank bonds (like Quicken)
Oil bonds
Tech bonds

We need to begin identifying BTOs (if possible (BTOs are just CLO/CDOs, because of course they are)) that target these assets. They're going to fail. Stay tuned, I'm just writing this down so I don't forget it.


# Wall-Street-Bets-Master-Doc
Hey, guys. Welcome to the GitHub page. We'll be splitting it up into a few different sections, depending on area of research. 

The workflow of this project is largely going to be dictated by its main purpose, which is analyzing banks. There are a few subtopics that we might explore that lie a bit outside the scope of that, but by and large, the thrust is banks. Here's a rough outline of the game plan, broken down into steps:

1. FA team will populate a list of vulnerable banks that have failed stress tests recently. 
2. They'll be crosschecked by other FA members until a consensus is reached on risk levels; justifications for each in a writeup would be great
3. Those banks will then be passed on to the TA/data guys, who can set up a bunch of indicators and alerts and generally work their computer magic to best predict the window in which these will fail; graphs and math are appreciated


Some tentative deadlines I'd like to set for each of the steps are

1. 3/20/20 for a comprehensive (not exhaustive) list of at-risk banks
2. 4/3/20 for completed analysis and approval of a list of banks
3. 4/3/20 for a set of agreed-upon tracking strategies for the targets. 

I'd like semi-regular check-ins with progress. Say, a minimum of once a week, perhaps Saturday. More often isn't worse. You don't necessarily have to add to the document directly; you can report it to me or another member who's willing to compile it and write it up in a nice, legible fashion. 

I want to nominate a few people to take point on the various aspects of this project; I'll reach out to people by DM to ask them if they're up for it. So far, technicalANAList has agreed to lead the TA team. Cannabiz-420 (Ti-84 on discord) will head the FA team. Beethoven is on top of Macro trends. They're tasked with outlining objectives for your team, cooperating with other team leaders, and generally managing the workflow within their unit. 

If you have any concerns, comments, questions, or suggestions, please feel free to hit me up on discord or on Reddit.

I really appreciate your time and enthusiasm, guys. I'm stunned that I was met with such a flood of excited talent; you guys are experts and actual powerhouses in each of your fields. It's impressive, and I'm really happy to be a part of this. I'm going to do my best here to keep morale up and attention focused; the death of this project will be waning enthusiasm. I don't want to act like a boss or a manager, but I do want to keep everyone working towards this goal. Expect to put at least an hour or two of work into this every week to keep the wheels turning. As long as everything keeps flowing, I'll be here nonstop to keep things moving and handle anything that needs handling. I don't know how this is going to turn out, but between the lot of you, there's an incredible pool of potential to tap into and use to our advantage. Let's make some tendies, guys.
